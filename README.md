# RLI V2

Do to the slow dev time of rust, I have re-implemented RLI using python. This was a move I made because there were a lot of features I wanted but the support is not as good for rust.

# Getting started

For this project we are using a tool called [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the project. Make is also used to put all commands in one place.

## Setup

Run the command `make init`

## Testing

Run the command `make test`

## Building

Run the command `make build`

## Integration test

Run the command `make integration-test`

## Formatting

Run the command `make format`

## Linting
